## Testing Checklist — v1.2.0

- [x] Mana curve: spells only, no lands in histogram
- [x] Mana curve: CMC 7+ bucket includes all cards with CMC ≥ 7
- [x] Mana curve: bar heights normalized to tallest bucket
- [x] Mana curve: count label above each bar, CMC label below
- [x] Lands strip: correct count and percentage
- [x] Current Hand: cards in hand count matches hand display
- [x] Current Hand: lands count correct
- [x] Current Hand: avg CMC excludes lands; shows `—` with all-land hand
- [x] Draw Odds: lands visible by default
- [x] Draw Odds: lands toggle hides/shows lands instantly
- [x] Draw: live % updates immediately after clicking Draw
- [x] Draw: normalized bar shrinks when a copy is drawn
- [x] Mulligan: all bars reset to full
- [x] Mulligan: live % resets correctly
- [x] Color thresholds: green ≥ 8%, yellow ≥ 4%, red < 4%
- [x] Bar color and % always match
- [x] 0-copy cards are hidden
- [x] Pin via card name: star + blue row + floats to top
- [x] Pin via card image: blue ring + star badge
- [ ] Pin synced between list and grid --- we don't have list view/grid view toggle in the test hand modal but this would be useful for future verions.
- [x] Multiple pins work simultaneously
- [x] Mulligan clears all pins
- [x] Sort order: pinned first, then by live % descending within each group
- [x] Mulligan counter: starts at 0 on modal open
- [x] Mulligan counter: increments by 1 each mulligan
- [x] Mulligan counter: resets on modal close and reopen
- [x] No regression: Draw button works as before
- [x] No regression: Mulligan button works as before
- [x] No regression: library depleted state works as before

---

## Emerging Issues
- "Pin synced between list and grid" checklist item left unchecked — Phi noted there is no list/grid view toggle inside the modal. This is correct; the spec's "list" = Draw Odds sidebar rows, "grid" = card hand grid. Both surfaces update the same `marked` state, so pin sync IS working as designed. The checklist item wording is misleading — no follow-up needed.

---

## Session Summary — v1.2.0
Status: APPROVED ✅

### Gate Check
- Plan Review gate held: no files touched until PROCEED ✅
- Testing Checklist gate held: paused after build before APPROVED ✅
- Build-in-one-pass pattern followed (single-file feature) ✅

### Opening Hand Simulator Stats Panel — #4, #7, #9

**New state:** `marked: Set<string>` (pinned card IDs), `showLands: boolean` (Draw Odds filter, default true), `mulliganCount: number` (starts at 0, increments on Mulligan, never persisted).

**Named constants:** `PROB_GREEN = 0.08`, `PROB_YELLOW = 0.04` at top of file — pre-named for Commander recalibration.

**Initial draw:** Separated from `shuffleAndDraw` so `mulliganCount` stays at 0 on modal open. `shuffleAndDraw` (Mulligan button) increments counter and resets `marked`.

**Mana Curve (#4):** Histogram with CMC buckets 1–7+ (spells only; 0-CMC spells clamped to bucket 1). Bars normalized to tallest bucket, count label above, CMC label below. Lands strip immediately below: emerald swatch, `N / total`, percentage. Static — computed from deck prop with empty `useMemo` deps.

**Current Hand:** Live stats: cards in hand, land count, avg CMC of spells only. Shows `—` when hand contains no spells (all lands). Wraps in `useMemo([hand])`.

**Draw Odds (#7):** One row per unique card with >0 copies remaining in library. Live %, normalized bar (`barFill = liveProb / maxProb`), color-coded by threshold (both % and bar always same color). Sorted pinned-first then live% desc within each group. Lands toggle filters instantly. Wraps in `useMemo([library, libraryCounts, marked, showLands])`.

**Pin interaction:** Clicking a card name row in Draw Odds or a card image in the hand grid both call `toggleMark(card.id)` — same state, always in sync. Pinned row: blue background, border, filled `Star` icon, `text-blue-300` name. Pinned card image: `ring-2 ring-blue-500` + blue `Star` badge top-right. Multiple pins allowed. Mulligan clears all with `setMarked(new Set())`.

**Mulligan counter (#9):** Header subtitle updated from `Library: N | Hand: N` to `Hand: N · Library: N · Mulligans: N`.

### Carry-Forwards
None — all items complete.

## How This File Works
This file is the live session journal shared between Phi, Claude Chat, and Claude Code.
- **Claude Code writes:** Plan review table, testing checklist, session summary — but only commits to git at the end of the session in a clean completed state
- **Phi writes:** Test results (checking boxes), inline comments on failures, emerging issues during QA
- **Claude Chat reads:** Verifies plan review for ghost fixes, triages failures and emerging issues, incorporates findings into next Claude Code prompt
- At any point during a multi-day session, anyone can read this file to see the current state of the build
- Never committed to git mid-session — only in the final commit alongside CLAUDE.md and CHANGELOG.md

## Current Release: v1.1.7
Status: APPROVED ✅

## Plan Review — v1.1.7

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/components/workspace/ListCardTable.tsx` | Item 1: Add `getRowHoverTint()` helper; add `hoveredRowId` state; apply brightened tint on `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`; yellow highlight rows skip hover brightening. Item 2: Update `getRowTint()` — Land (type_line-based) → tan/brown `rgba(180,140,90,0.15)`; colorless non-land → gray `rgba(150,150,150,0.12)`. Item 4: Split `overLimit` into `atCopyLimit` (=4, green text) and `overCopyLimit` (≥5, red text + tooltip); badge shows at 4+. |
| `src/components/workspace/DeckDropdown.tsx` | Item 3: Remove `setIsOpen(false)` from deck name button onClick; add `e.stopPropagation()` to match radio button pattern. Item 5: Replace `{d.name}` with `{d.name \|\| "Untitled"}`; apply `text-neutral-500` to fallback text only. |
| `src/components/workspace/VisualCard.tsx` | Item 4: Split `overCopyLimit` into `atCopyLimit` (=4) / `overCopyLimit` (≥5) / `showCopyBadge`; qty span uses green at 4, red at 5+. |
| `src/config/version.ts` | Bump `APP_VERSION` to `"1.1.7"`, add changelog entry. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add v1.1.7 entry. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Version bump to v1.1.7; add `.md` file format note to Release Workflow step 2. |
| `REVIEW.md` | Plan review table, testing checklist (this file). |

## Testing Checklist — v1.1.7

### Item 1 — Hover Highlight
- [ ] List view: hovering a tinted row brightens the tint color subtly
- [ ] List view: hovering a row with yellow highlight — hover brightening does NOT appear (yellow wins)
- [ ] List view: moving mouse off a row — tint returns to base immediately
- [ ] Grid view: no hover behavior change (unaffected)

### Item 2 — Colorless vs Land Tint
- [ ] Basic Land (e.g. Forest) shows tan/brown tint in list view
- [ ] Fetch land (e.g. Verdant Catacombs) shows tan/brown tint
- [ ] Triome (e.g. Jetmir's Garden — has colors) shows tan/brown tint
- [ ] Colorless artifact (e.g. Sol Ring) shows neutral gray tint
- [ ] Eldrazi or other colorless non-land shows neutral gray tint
- [ ] Colored cards unaffected — existing tints intact
- [ ] Hover brightening works correctly on tan/brown and gray tint rows

### Item 3 — Deck Name Click
- [ ] Clicking a deck name switches the active deck
- [ ] Dropdown stays open after clicking a deck name
- [ ] Clicking the radio button still works as before (switches deck, stays open)
- [ ] No regression: deck name text still visible and styled correctly

### Item 4 — 4-Copy Badge
- [ ] Grid view: badge qty text is gray at 3 copies (or badge absent — per existing logic)
- [ ] Grid view: badge qty text is green at exactly 4 copies
- [ ] Grid view: badge qty text is red at 5+ copies
- [ ] List view: same progression as grid view
- [ ] No regression to other card count colors (toolbar, owned counter)

### Item 5 — Untitled Deck in Dropdown
- [ ] A deck with no name shows "Untitled" in gray in the dropdown
- [ ] A deck with a user-entered name shows that name in normal white text
- [ ] Active deck indicator (blue dot) still displays correctly on unnamed decks

## Emerging Issues
None.

## Session Summary — v1.1.7

### Gate Check
- Build-in-one-pass pattern followed (small release) ✅
- Testing Checklist written before pausing ✅
- APPROVED received before final commit ✅

### Item 1 — Hover Highlight Restored
Added `getRowHoverTint()` helper alongside `getRowTint()` — returns a higher-alpha version of the same RGBA color. Added `hoveredRowId` state. Updated `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` to set/clear `hoveredRowId`. Row `style` now reads `hoveredRowId === card.id ? getRowHoverTint(card) : getRowTint(card)`. Yellow-highlighted rows keep `style` as `undefined`, so hover brightening is bypassed. Removed the now-redundant `hover:bg-neutral-800/40` Tailwind class (was overridden by inline style since v1.1.6 tint landed).

### Item 2 — Land vs Colorless Tint
Updated `getRowTint()` to check `card.type_line?.includes("Land")` before the `colors` array check. Land → `rgba(180, 140, 90, 0.15)` (tan/brown). Colorless non-land (empty `colors`, no `Land` in type_line) → `rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.12)` (gray, bumped from 0.07). `getRowHoverTint()` mirrors: land → `rgba(180, 140, 90, 0.28)`, colorless → `rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.22)`.

### Item 3 — Deck Name Click Stays Open
Removed `setIsOpen(false)` from the deck name button's `onClick`. Added `e.stopPropagation()` to match the radio button pattern exactly. No visual changes.

### Item 4 — 4-Copy Badge Color Progression
Replaced single `overLimit` boolean with `isExempt`, `atCopyLimit` (=4), `overCopyLimit` (≥5), `showCopyBadge` (≥4). Qty span: red at `overCopyLimit`, green at `atCopyLimit`, neutral otherwise. Tooltip only renders at `overCopyLimit`. Applied in both `VisualCard.tsx` and `ListCardTable.tsx`.

### Item 5 — Untitled Deck in Dropdown
Deck name `<span>` renders `{d.name || "Untitled"}`. `text-neutral-500` applied conditionally (`!d.name`) — named decks inherit existing color unchanged.

### Carry-Forwards
None — all items complete.

## Plan Review — v1.1.6

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/components/workspace/DeckDropdown.tsx` | Item 1 (#77): Replace `pointer-events-none` blue dot span with a clickable radio element. Active deck: filled blue dot. Inactive decks: hollow gray circle (`border border-neutral-500 rounded-full w-2 h-2`). Click inactive → switches active deck, dropdown stays open. Click active → no-op. Tooltip "Switch deck" on inactive only. `e.stopPropagation()` prevents deck-name click from firing. |
| `src/components/workspace/ListCardTable.tsx` | Item 2 (#47): Add `sortBy?: string` and `isGrouped?: boolean` props. When `isGrouped === false` and `sortBy === 'color'` or `'mv'`, detect group boundary between adjacent cards (color group key or cmc change) and add `mt-4` spacer to the first row of each new group. Item 3 (#56): Change 4-copy badge qty span from `text-yellow-400` to `text-red-400`. |
| `src/components/workspace/WorkspaceToolbar.tsx` | Item 3 (#56): Toolbar card count — green (`text-green-400`) at exactly 60, red (`text-red-400`) over 60 (was yellow at ≥ 60). Item 4 (#57): Active Main/Side pill changes from `bg-neutral-800 text-white` to `bg-blue-600 text-white`. Item 5 (#70): Deck name input placeholder changed to "Untitled" with `placeholder:text-neutral-500`; `size` fallback added for empty name. |
| `src/components/workspace/VisualCard.tsx` | Item 3 (#56): Change 4-copy badge qty span from `text-yellow-400` to `text-red-400`. |
| `src/components/workspace/Workspace.tsx` | Pass `sortBy` and `isGrouped` props to both `ListCardTable` call sites (grouped view inner table and ungrouped list view). |
| `src/config/version.ts` | Bump `APP_VERSION` to `"1.1.6"` and add changelog entry. |
| `BACKLOG.md` | Clear the two workflow items that are in-scope for this session. Timestamps and any new unpromoted items stay. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Version bump to v1.1.6; close #47, #53, #56, #57, #70 in backlog (mark closed this release); add #77 to backlog; add BACKLOG.md promoted-item cleanup rule to Key Technical Notes. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add v1.1.6 entry. |

**Waiting for PROCEED before touching any files.**

## Testing Checklist — v1.1.6

### Item 1 — #77: Deck Dropdown Radio Buttons
- [x] Active deck row shows a filled blue dot on the left (same visual as before)
- [x] Inactive deck rows show a hollow gray circle outline on the left
- [x] Clicking the hollow gray circle on an inactive deck → switches active deck, dropdown stays open
- [x] Clicking the filled blue dot on the active deck → no-op (nothing happens, dropdown stays open)
- [x] Clicking a deck name still switches that deck and closes the dropdown (existing behavior unchanged)
- [x] Hovering the hollow gray circle on an inactive deck shows tooltip "Switch deck"
- [x] No tooltip on the active deck dot
- [x] No tooltip on deck name
- [x] Clicking the radio button does NOT also trigger the deck name click behavior (stopPropagation works)

### Item 2 — #47: Sort Group Separators in List View
- [ ] Switch to List view, sort by Color — clean h-3 spacer row between groups; spacer is transparent (app background shows through, not table bg)
- [ ] Switch to List view, sort by Mana Value — same clean spacer between CMC groups
- [x] Switch to List view, sort by Name — NO extra spacing added
- [x] Switch to List view, sort by Original — NO extra spacing added
- [x] Enable Group By Type — NO extra spacing added (type headers already provide visual separation)
- [x] Grid view is completely unaffected

### Item 3 — #56: Card Count Color Progression + 4-Copy Badge Color
- [x] Toolbar card count shows white text when total < 60 (default)
- [x] Toolbar card count turns green (`text-green-400`) at exactly 60 cards
- [x] Toolbar card count turns red (`text-red-400`) when over 60 cards
- [x] 4-copy warning badge in grid view appears red (not yellow) when a card reaches 5+ copies
- [x] 4-copy warning badge in list view appears red (not yellow) when a card reaches 5+ copies
- [x] Sideboard card count (X / 15): white below 15, green at exactly 15, red above 15

### Item 4 — #57: Main/Side Pill Color
- [x] Active "Main" pill has blue background + white text
- [x] Active "Side" pill has blue background + white text
- [x] Inactive pill remains gray (unchanged)
- [x] Disabled "Side" pill (no sideboard) remains dark gray (unchanged)

### Item 5 — #70: Untitled Deck Name Placeholder
- [x] A new deck is created with an empty name — shows gray "Untitled" placeholder immediately (no "New Deck" default)
- [x] When the user types into the name field, text is white
- [x] When the user clears the name field entirely, the gray "Untitled" placeholder reappears
- [x] Existing deck names display and edit normally

### Item 6 — #13: List View Row Color Tinting (pulled forward from v1.2.0)
- [ ] White cards have a warm cream tint
- [ ] Blue cards have a blue tint
- [ ] Black cards have a purple/dark tint
- [ ] Red cards have a red tint
- [ ] Green cards have a green tint
- [ ] Multicolor cards (2+ colors) have a gold tint
- [ ] Colorless/land cards (empty colors array) have a neutral gray tint
- [ ] Yellow highlight on newly added card still overrides the tint
- [ ] Grid view has no tinting (list view only)

### Workflow Fixes
- [x] BACKLOG.md: two in-scope workflow items cleared; consolidation timestamp line remains ✅ (timestamp stays by design — it marks when the log was last consolidated, not a promoted item)
- [x] CLAUDE.md: version reads v1.1.6
- [x] version.ts reads 1.1.6
- [x] CHANGELOG.md has v1.1.6 entry at the top
- [x] Gate check: Plan Review step held (no files touched until PROCEED) ✅ — terminal session

## Emerging Issues
<!-- Phi fills this in during QA -->

## Session Summary — v1.1.6
Status: APPROVED ✅

### Gate Check — Item 7
- Plan Review gate held: no files touched until PROCEED ✅
- Testing Checklist gate held: two rounds of carry-forward fixes before APPROVED ✅
- Session type: terminal

### Item 1 — #77: Deck Dropdown Radio Buttons
Replaced the `pointer-events-none` blue dot span in `DeckDropdown.tsx` with a clickable button. Active deck: filled blue dot (`w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-blue-400`), cursor-default, no tooltip. Inactive decks: hollow gray circle (`w-2 h-2 border border-neutral-500`), cursor-pointer, tooltip "Switch deck", `e.stopPropagation()` prevents deck-name button from firing. Clicking inactive radio sets active deck and keeps dropdown open.

### Item 2 — #47: Sort Group Separators in List View
Added `sortBy` and `isGrouped` props to `ListCardTable`. Added `getGroupKey()` helper that keys by color group or CMC depending on sort mode. When `!isGrouped && (sortBy === 'color' || sortBy === 'mv')`, a `<React.Fragment>` wraps each row and a transparent `h-3` spacer `<tr>` is inserted at group boundaries. Spacer `<td>` has `bg-transparent` so app background shows through. `Workspace.tsx` passes `sortBy` and `isGrouped` at both `ListCardTable` call sites.

### Item 3 — #56 + #53: Card Count Color Progression + 4-Copy Badge
`WorkspaceToolbar.tsx`: main deck count — green at exactly 60, red above 60 (was yellow at ≥ 60). Sideboard count — green at exactly 15, red above 15 (was yellow at > 15). `VisualCard.tsx` and `ListCardTable.tsx`: 4-copy warning badge qty span changed from `text-yellow-400` to `text-red-400`.

### Item 4 — #57: Main/Side Pill Color
Active pill style changed from `bg-neutral-800 text-white border-neutral-700/50` to `bg-blue-600 text-white border-blue-500/50` in `WorkspaceToolbar.tsx`. Applied to both Main and Side active states.

### Item 5 — #70: Untitled Deck Name Placeholder
`WorkspaceToolbar.tsx`: changed `placeholder="Enter deck name..."` to `placeholder="Untitled"` with `placeholder:text-neutral-500`. `useDeckManager.tsx`: all four `name: "New Deck"` occurrences changed to `name: ""` so new decks and default decks start unnamed and show the placeholder.

### Item 6 — #13: List View Row Color Tinting (pulled forward from v1.2.0)
Added `getRowTint()` helper in `ListCardTable.tsx` that returns a subtle RGBA background color based on `card.colors`: W cream, U blue, B purple, R red, G green, multicolor gold, colorless/land neutral gray. Applied via `style={{ backgroundColor: getRowTint(card) }}` on `<tr>` — suppressed when the row is highlighted (yellow highlight takes precedence). Grid view unaffected.

### Workflow Fixes
- BACKLOG.md: two in-scope workflow items cleared; consolidation timestamp retained by design.
- CLAUDE.md: version bumped to v1.1.6; #47, #53, #56, #57, #70 closed this release; #13 closed (pulled forward from v1.2.0); #77 added to backlog; BACKLOG.md promoted-item cleanup rule added to Key Technical Notes.

### Carry-Forwards
None — all items complete.

## Previous Session History

### v1.1.5 Testing Results
Status: APPROVED ✅

### Fix 1 — #55: Blue dot non-interactive
Moved the blue dot span outside the deck-select button in `DeckDropdown.tsx`. The dot now sits as a sibling element with `pointer-events-none` and `ml-3` positioning, visually identical to before. Clicking it does nothing. Clicking the deck name still switches deck and closes dropdown.

### Fix 2 — #59: showThumbnail persistence
Added `THUMBNAIL_KEY = "mtg-show-thumbnail"` constant in `useDeckManager.tsx`. Loaded on mount in the existing `useEffect` with fallback default of `true`. Saved via new `useEffect` on `[showThumbnail, isMounted]`. Sort preference persistence confirmed intact — no changes needed.

### Fix 3 — #48: Owned counter inline typing
Added inline editing to the owned counter in both `VisualCard.tsx` and `ListCardTable.tsx`. Mirrors the existing qty counter pattern exactly. Validation matches `updateOwnedQty` — any integer ≥ 0 commits; empty or non-numeric reverts silently. `isOwnedEscaping` ref prevents blur-after-escape double-commit.

### Housekeeping
- CLAUDE.md: version bumped to v1.1.5; 7 items discarded from backlog; 5 items moved to v2.0; priority notes added; #76 promoted; triage process added to Session Start; `mtg-show-thumbnail` added to persistence keys list.
- BACKLOG.md: consolidation prompt updated with empty-consolidation guard and items-before-timestamp rule; #76 item cleared.
- CHANGELOG.md and version.ts updated.

### Carry-Forwards
None — all items in this sprint are complete.

## Previous Session History

### v1.1.4 Testing Results
### Fix 1 — Grid View 4-Copy Tooltip Text
- [x] ⚠️ tooltip in grid view reads "Exceeds 4-copy limit"
- [x] Old text "Exceeds the 4-copy limit for standard play" no longer appears anywhere in grid or list view

### Fix 2 — Tooltip Max-Width Cap
- [x] List view 4-copy tooltip no longer clips
- [x] Tooltip text wraps cleanly within max-width when needed
- [x] Export List tooltip — max-width cap present
- [x] Import List tooltip — max-width cap present
- [x] TCGPlayer / Card Kingdom tooltips — max-width cap present
- [x] Test Deck tooltip — max-width cap present
- [x] Sort ↑/↓ tooltip — max-width cap present
- [x] Group / Grid / List view toggle tooltips — max-width cap present
- [x] Main / Side pill tooltips — max-width cap present
- [x] No horizontal scroll reintroduced

### REVIEW.md Workflow
- [x] REVIEW.md written with plan review table before execution
- [x] REVIEW.md updated with testing checklist after build
- [x] Emerging Issues section present and ready for Phi to fill in
- [ ] REVIEW.md committed to git only in the final post-release commit --- no way to verify and test this until the end when we give the APPROVED

---

## v1.1.4 Emerging Issues
- make a note that once Claude Code goes through a few sessions where the Plan Review table aligns with the prompt from Claude Chat, then we can probably trust it more and remove this review process? speeds things up. but we still want to keep the testing Checklist hold for QA
- 💡 Tooltip max-width cap solves clipping but visual treatment needs polish — revisit during UI polish sweep for a better solution.

---

## Previous Session History

### v1.1.3 Testing Results
### Fix 1 — 4-Copy Tooltip Text
- [x] ⚠️ badge tooltip reads "Exceeds 4-copy limit" — not clipped
- [ ] Tooltip visible on all rows in list view — ⚠️ still clips slightly in list view, less severe. Grid view still has old text. Carry forward to v1.1.4.

### Fix 2 — X Button Tooltip
- [x] No tooltip on X button in grid view
- [x] No tooltip on X button in list view (regression check)
- [x] X button still functions correctly in both views

### Fix 3 — Main/Side Tooltips
- [x] "Main" button shows tooltip "Switch to main deck"
- [x] "Side" button shows tooltip "Switch to sideboard"
- [x] Tooltips visible and not clipped
- [x] All other row 3 tooltips still present (regression check)

### v1.1.3 Emerging Issues
- 🐛 Grid view 4-copy tooltip still shows old text "Exceeds the 4-copy limit for standard play" — needs same update as list view
- 🐛 List view 4-copy tooltip still clips slightly — needs proper root cause diagnosis before fixing
- 💡 Consider a global max-width cap on all tooltips to prevent long text clipping regardless of content

---

## Session Summary — v1.1.4

All checklist items passed. One REVIEW.md workflow item deferred by design (can't verify "committed only at session end" until the commit happens — inherent to the process).

### Carry-Forwards
- Tooltip visual treatment needs polish (#60) — tracked in backlog, not a blocker

### New Backlog Items Created This Session
#47 Visual separator between sort groups | #48 Owned counter inline typing | #49 Version badge revisit | #50 Dark/light theme | #51 Buy button layout | #52 Price → TCGPlayer link | #53 60-card soft warning | #54 Progress bar width | #55 Blue dot dropdown bug | #56 Color progression on counts | #57 Main/Side pill color | #58 Sideboard pricing | #59 Settings persistence | #60 Tooltip polish
